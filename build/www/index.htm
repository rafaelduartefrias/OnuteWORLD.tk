<h1>Attention for everyone</h1>
<h3>This site is being patched forever immediately by total of users on GoAnimate Remastered discord server.</h3>
<h3>READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY!</h3>
<p>Please remember, I was a beginner I installed GoAnimate Remastered server package on March 18, 2020 and it runs very good. But for this time, all of users raiding on my Discord server (I don't wanna to get reported for that). Ok, fine! I just taken down the site, so I will never use it PROPORTIONALLY! (Note: I will just disable the port forwarding for this, I'm will be privately safe to use, if not, use this publically)</p>
<p>Now please use the BonziWORLD website instead. Please remember do not criticize the BonziWORLD community or else they will reveal your IP, you gonna get hunted down whole information for that. GoAnimate is no longer exists it. LVM deserves to die, he need to go to hell colloquially (I'll put Vyonder character to make LVM character is deserving to die or I shot the LVM). If you leave the LVM alive, I will break your router with my sledgehammer or banhammer. Don't you dare bring back.</p>
<p><b>IF YOU BRING BACK THE LVM WHEN IT'S BEING SHUT DOWN FOR REQUEST SUPPORT, BUT NO YOU DIDN'T SHUT DOWN THIS SERVER PROPERTY, THEN I WILL TELL VYOND A EMAIL AND A LITTLE INFO ABOUT THIS! HE WILL CALL THE COPS NOW BY A EMPLOYEE!</b></p>
<br><br>
<p>Use this site instead right now.</p>
