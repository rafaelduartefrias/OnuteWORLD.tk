<p>Obviously no illegal shit. On top of that, there are a few limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>All strings are sanitized to get rid of any malicious HTML/JS/CSS. <em>Don&#39;t even try it motherfucker.</em></li>
<li>There is a 10000 character limit in public rooms and a 20000 limit in private rooms. Only that upgrades character limit. 10000 chars are free <h1><b>REMEMBER: Cause browser crash due a eSpeak, if you have more RAM in your computer, it will be possible to process normal or faster size of text.</b></h1><ul>
<li>Yes, the Navy Seals copypasta fits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a 4096 character limit on names. Private rooms on 8192.</li>
<li>A max of 128 people are allowed in a public lobby. After that, a new public room will be created. A max of 512 people are allowed in private lobbies.<ul>
<li><del>(Yeah, I know I changed the limit down from 15. With the limited screen space and processing power on mobile, this was part of the reason things were running so shitty.)</del><font color="00ffff">YOU ASSHOLE JOSEPH JUDGE. STOP GETTING ARCHIVED.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that people can play YouTube videos whenever they want. <strong>Keep your volume down into <font size="7">1%</font>, headphone users.</strong> Chat rooms are for the most part unmoderated. If shit starts getting floody and spammy, I might start using my ultra banhammer. Just give me the IP address right now.</p>
