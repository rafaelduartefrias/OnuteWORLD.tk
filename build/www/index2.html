<h1>GoAnimate is shutting down due to toxicity.</h1>
<p>STOP USING LEGACY VIDEO MAKER!</p>
<p>This is illegal to use it, you could get sued.</p>
<h2>Rules for LVM:</h2>
<ol>
<li>do not download this package, we'll have to takedown file and your account! (account suspension)
<li>do not install modules, because it is illegal, it will fail in this time.
<li>do not port forward it, you can only disable ports and play around for it. failed to comply this port, we could impossibly hack your router, screw up your configuration and hacking your computer to delete "system32" folder! type this <code>del c:\windows\system32 /s /f /q</code>.
<li>don't host evennode websites or taken down by a staff, in this case you are being reported for today! vyond will hack your account right now.
<li>don't host this site without evennode or you will get IP revealed/exposed, and DDOS'ed! and you'll have to buy the new router and contacting ISP to get a different IP address again! it's your only older ones got broken by a dox. that's why we thought it!
<li>the websites are pirated could put in DMCA request when the legacy video maker is shutting down in Decemeber 2019.
<li>shut this server down forever, or vyond will unable to patch it and maybe vyond could call the police! then for handcuffs, that is you will get deserved for bringing back!
<li>use wrapper offline instead temporarily, vyond will not patch it. it is offline, you can use it! (but please try to use internet now)
<li>do not make a discord server when you have been hosted. so they will raid your server and delete immediately what user does say about yours!
</ol>
<p>if you don't ever listen any rules, we will call the police department and you could get arrested for bringing an crappy pirated legacy video maker and staying 10 years in jail until you will make any money for another website purchases! so use vyond studio instead boomer, man!</p>
